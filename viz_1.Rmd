```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

Import the weather data

```{r}
data("weather_df")
```

Making our first plot :-)

Use the `+` operator to link together your code in ggplot (kind of like the pipe operator but for ggplot)

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather_df, mapping = aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + #telling R which data, and which variables
  geom_point()

```
